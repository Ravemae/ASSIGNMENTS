#1. True and False: They are truth values in Python. They are the results of comparison operations or logical (Boolean) operations in Python. For example:
    E.G; when 1==1 the output would be true  and  when  10 <= 1 the output would be false'
#2. None: is special constant in Python that represents the absence of a value or a null value.('an empty string 0 or (")'). It is an object of its own datatype (Nonetype). We cannot create multiple objects but we can assign it to variables
    'E.G; None == 0 output is false and if x = None and y = None , x == y output is true'
#3. Output: This program has a function that does not return a value, although it does some operations inside.
#4. As: is used to create an alias while importing a module. It means giving a different name (user-defined) to a module while importing it. 
    'E.G; Python has a standard module called math. If we want to calculate what cosine pi is using an alias We can do it as  "import maths as myAlias" '
#5. Assert is used for debugging purposes. Assert is followed by a condition. i.e if the condition is true, nothing happens. But if the condition is false, AssertionError is raised.
#6. The async and await keywords are provided by the asyncio library in Python. They are used to write concurrent code in Python. For example,
#7. break and continue are used inside for and while loops to alter their normal behavior. break will end the smallest loop it is in and control flows to the statement immediately below the loop
 to the statement immediately below the loop. continue causes to end the current iteration of the loop, but not the whole loop.
